# Implemenetation of the ERC20 standard. 

# About 
This is a foundry project that features two implementations of the ERC-20 token standard. 
1.  The first implementation is done manually by implementing all the mandatory methods of the ERC20 standard available [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)
2.  The second implementation uses the [Openzepplin Wizard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard) 


# What does the project do?
Creates a standard ERC-20 token with features like: 
- The total supply
- The Token ticker and name. 
- Methods to transfer and approve tokens, etc. 
  

# Misc
- Contains scripts to deploy the contract and some initial tests written in Foundry. 

## WIP
- More tests
